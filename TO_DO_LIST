1. Create a copy of the script within the repo
2. Remove all the comments within the original file, the copy file will contain the comments. For new additions, the copy file will be updated as well while adding new comments where necessary
3. Modify "DAY_OF_WEEK=$( date +%u)" to "DAY_OF_WEEK=$(date +%u)"
4. Add this comment to the sleep 15 command - "Wait 15 seconds for the server to gather the entire data - in case of weak internet connection" + add a retry mechanism :

"# Download data from BNR with retry mechanism
download_data() {
  attempt=1
  max_attempts=3
  while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do

    # Attempt to download data from BNR
    curl https://bnr.ro/RSS_200003_EUR.aspx >> /home/$USERNAME/output.txt

    # Check if output.txt contains data
    if [ -s /home/$USERNAME/output.txt ]; then
      return 0  # Success
    else
      echo "Attempt $attempt: Download failed or empty. Retrying..."
      ((attempt++))
      sleep 30  # Wait for 10 seconds before retrying
    fi
  done
  echo "Failed to download data after $max_attempts attempts."
  return 1  # Failure
}

# Attempt to download data with retry
download_data

# Check if download was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Data download failed. Exiting."
  exit 1
fi"

5. Make the script compare the today's value with the one from yesterday ( within the code, make it look for yesterday's value and the day before that ) and send the email with an additional "The value is higher/lower than yesterday" line.
