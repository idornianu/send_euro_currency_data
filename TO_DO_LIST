Bug fixes:
- Tidy up the code: remove the "sed" command from the 'send email' part of the script; for the 's-nail' command, remove the hard coded email address for the recipient and create a variable called "RECIPIENT"

Features:
- Make the script compare the today's value with the one from yesterday ( within the code, make it look for yesterday's value and the day before that ) and send the email with an additional "The value is higher/lower than yesterday" line.
- Create an average value for the currency for the week - to be sent Monday morning weekly
